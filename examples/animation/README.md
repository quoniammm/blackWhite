# Animation Examples

The animation examples consist of three parts, each on a separate page.

## Simple Animation: Transform, Repeat, Reverse

The bouncing element demonstrates a simple animation of different properties of a widget.
Using the animation's `repeat` and `reverse` properties, the animation is played backwards once finished to restore the widget's original state.

## People: Different Easings

This example shows multiple animations with different easing functions.

## Tray: User Controlled

This example shows how to integrate a user controlled (event based) interaction with an animation.
A typical use case for this integration is a tray.

The tray can be dragged into place manually, but when the finger is lifted, an animation will continue to move the tray into its final position.
The demo uses touch events and combines them with an animation.
