# Npm Modules

This example includes a third-party module from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), the Node.js package manager. Third-party modules must be listed in the [dependencies](https://www.npmjs.com/doc/files/package.json.html#dependencies) field in the `package.json` file.

To install these modules from npm, run `npm install` in the main directory of the application. This will download the modules and place them in a directory `node_modules`, where they are found by Tabris.js.
